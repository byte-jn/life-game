# life-game-en
A generation of a story about your hero in the terminal using Python.

When the Python script is started, the terminal opens, and a story about the hero is generated. It is presented only in text form. There are also battles and different types of weapons. Ice is an auto-battler, which means you can only watch what Harald does. You can also add new locations and people in the files enemy.json and location.json. Umlauts are possible. No letters with specific starting letters are allowed.

(Ae) = Ä
(Oe) = Ö
